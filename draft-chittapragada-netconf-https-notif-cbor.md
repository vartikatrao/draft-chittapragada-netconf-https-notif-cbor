# Introduction

~~~~ quote
CBOR offers an efficient and compact representation of YANG.
~~~~

This document introduces a CBOR encoding scheme for event notifications over HTTPS by using the framework proposed in {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}} which supports transfer of YANG notifications over HTTPS using JSON and XML encoding schemes.


In {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}, the capabilities HTTP-target resource allows a publisher to retrieve supported encoding formats via GET requests, while the relay-notification resource enables the publisher to send YANG notifications via POST requests. These requests and responses use different content types based on the selected encoding scheme. This document defines support for using CBOR encoding defined in section 1 of {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}

Examples of the GET and POST request and reply encoded in CBOR are also provided.


# Terminology

This document uses the following terms defined in Section 2,3 and 4 of {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}:

   - Capabilities Resource

   - Relay-Notification

   - Event Notification

The following term(s) are defined in Subscription to YANG Notifications {{!RFC8639}}:

   - Publisher

   - Receiver

   - Subscribed Notifications

The following term(s) are defined in Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) {{!RFC9254}}:

   - Diagnostic Notifications

   - YANG Schema Item iDentifier (or "YANG SID" or simply "SID"): 63-bit unsigned integer used to identify different YANG items.



# CBOR Encoding of the notification(s)

YANG notifications can be encoded in CBOR using Names or SIDs in keys. Notifications encoded using names is similar to JSON encoding as defined in Section 3.4 and 4.3 of {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}. Notification encoded using YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys of the CBOR encoded message with a 63 bit unsigned integer.  In this case, the term 'SID' is defined in Section 3.2 of {{!RFC9254}}, and the keys of the encoded data use SID value as mentioned in 4.3.2 of this document.

## Capabilities Request

The publisher sends a request to the receiver to learn its capabilities. In the below example, the “Accept” states that the publisher wants to receive the capabilities response in CBOR but if not supported then in XML or JSON in that order.

~~~ http-request
GET /some/path/capabilities HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/cbor, application/xml;0.5, application/json;q=0.9
~~~

## Capabilities Response

 If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and assuming it is only capable of receiving CBOR encoded messages the response would look like this

If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and assuming it is not capable of receiving cbor, but can receive both json and xml notifications:

 If the receiver is unable to reply using "application/cbor", but is capable of receiving only cbor then the response might look like this:

       "urn:ietf:capability:https-notif-receiver:encoding:cbor"
        ]
      }
   }
~~~

##  Relay Notification request

The publisher sends an HTTP POST request to the "relay-notification" resource on the receiver with the "Content-Type" header set to "application/cbor" in case the receiver is CBOR capable and a body containing the notification encoded in CBOR.

## Relay Notification Response

The response on success is  "204 (No Content)". In case of corrupted or malformed event, the response is an appropriate HTTP error response.

  - Capabilities discovery via HTTP GET to /capabilities
  - Event publication via HTTP POST to /relay-notification
  - Support for name-based CBOR encoding as described in this document

  The implementation is based on  draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15 and draft-chittapragada-netconf-https-notif-cbor-03.

- *Licensing*:
  Freely distributable under an MIT-style license.

- *Implementation Experience*:
  - Developed and demonstrated at IETF 121 and 122 Hackathon.
  - Worked toward enabling CBOR encoding in the libyang library as part of the hackathon effort ([slides](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/123/materials/slides-123-hackathon-sessd-adding-cbor-support-in-libyang-00)).
  - Evaluated CBOR efficiency compared to JSON and XML in constrained environments.
  - Built tooling to simulate and measure notification transfer behavior over varying network conditions.
  - Diagnostic encoding examples used for validation of CBOR structures.

# Security Considerations

Addition of the CBOR encoding introduces no specific security exposures or risks other that the ones mentioned in {{!RFC9254}} and {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}} (An HTTPS-based Transport for YANG Notifications)

# IANA Considerations

This document requests that IANA include an additional entry in the “Capabilities for HTTPS Notification Receivers” registry, defined in {{!I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}. The following entry is added:

~~~
Record:
   URN:         urn:ietf:params:yang-notif:https-capability:encoding:cbor
   Reference:   RFC XXXX:An HTTPS-based Transport for YANG Notifications
   Description: Identifies support for CBOR-encoded notifications.
